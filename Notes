The purpose of using AJAX in this problem statement is to send user registration data to the server without refreshing the entire page. This provides a seamless user experience and improves the overall responsiveness of the application.
AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) as a technique for making asynchronous communication between a web page and a server without reloading the entire page.

The POST method is an HTTP request method used in AJAX to send data to the server for processing. It is typically used when submitting forms or uploading large amounts of data to the server.

Local storage is a web browser API that provides a way to store data locally within the user's browser. It allows you to store and retrieve key-value pairs of data, which persists even after the browser is closed and reopened.Define local storage as a mechanism for web browsers to store key-value pairs of data persistently within the user's browser.
Explain that data stored in local storage remains accessible even after the browser window is closed or the page is refreshed.

Arrays in JavaScript are objects that store multiple values in a single variable. They are used to store an ordered collection of data items of the same or different types.  array is a JavaScript data structure that holds a collection of items, potentially suitable for temporary storage within the webpage session.
Discuss the advantage of arrays being accessible within the client-side code for manipulation and display.
Mention the limitation that data stored in an array is lost when the user closes the browser window or navigates away from the page.

Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that is widely used for tracking changes in source code files during the software development process. It allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, enabling efficient collaboration and code management. GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It provides a centralized platform for developers to store, manage, and collaborate on their Git repositories.
git init: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
git add .: Stages all the modified and new files for the next commit.
git commit -m "Commit message": Creates a new commit with the staged changes and a descriptive commit message.
git remote add origin <repository_url>: Adds a remote repository URL (e.g., your GitHub repository URL) with the name "origin."
git push -u origin master: Pushes the committed changes to the "master" branch of the remote "origin" repository and sets the upstream branch for future push/pull operations.

A README file is a plain text file that typically serves as the entry point and documentation for a Git repository. It usually contains information about the project, such as its purpose, installation instructions, usage examples, contributor guidelines, and other relevant details. Branches in Git represent independent lines of development. 

Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to build, deploy, and run applications inside containers. Containers are lightweight, stand-alone executable packages that include everything an application needs to run, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and dependencies. Containerization is the process of packaging an application and its dependencies into a self-contained, isolated environment called a container. 
Consistent Environments:
Problem: Imagine if a program works on one computer but not on another because they have different setups.
Solution: Docker makes sure that the program runs the same way no matter where it's used. This avoids confusion and "it works on my computer" issues.
Isolation and Dependency Management:
Problem: Sometimes, different programs need different tools or libraries, and managing these can get messy.
Solution: Docker puts each program and its necessary tools in its own little box (container). This way, they don't interfere with each other, and everything stays organized.
Efficient Resource Use:
Problem: Running many programs separately can use up a lot of computer resources like memory and processing power.
Solution: Docker uses these resources more efficiently by sharing them among programs, so you can run more things without slowing down your computer.
Scalability and Portability:
Problem: Moving programs between different places (like from a developer's computer to a server) can be tricky because of differences.
Solution: Docker makes it easy to move programs around because they come in these neat containers that work the same no matter where they're put. This also helps in making programs bigger or smaller as needed.
Microservices:
Problem: Big programs can be hard to manage and update because they're all stuck together.
Solution: Docker helps break big programs into smaller parts (microservices) that can be managed and updated independently. This makes things more flexible and easier to work with.
CI/CD Automation:
Problem: Testing and updating programs manually takes a lot of time and effort.
Solution: Docker can be set up to automatically test, build, and update programs, saving time and reducing errors in the process.
Docker ensures resource isolation and security through the following mechanisms:

Namespaces: Docker uses kernel namespaces to isolate resources like process trees, network interfaces, and file systems.
Control groups (cgroups): Docker utilizes cgroups to limit and control the resource usage of containers, such as CPU, memory, and disk I/O.
Union file system: Docker uses a layered file system (e.g., OverlayFS) to create a copy-on-write system, ensuring that changes made within a container are isolated from the host system.
Secure computing mode (Seccomp): Docker can restrict the system calls that can be made by containers, limiting their access to the host system.
